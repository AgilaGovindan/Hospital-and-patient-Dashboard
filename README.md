## 📌 Problem Statement

Hospitals generate large volumes of patient, admission, bed utilization, and billing data.  
Manual tracking makes it difficult to understand occupancy, patient flow, department performance, and revenue.

This project builds an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze:

• Patient admissions & discharges  
• Bed utilization  
• Department performance  
• Age group trends  
• Length of stay  
• Financial metrics  

---

## 📊 Tools Used

- Power BI  
- SQL  
- DAX  
- Excel  
- GitHub  

---

## 📂 Dataset

Hospital operational data including:

• Patients  
• Doctors  
• Admissions  
• Beds  
• Billing  
• Medicines  

(Synthetic dataset for learning purpose)

---

## 🔍 Primary Analysis

- Total Admissions
- Inpatients vs Outpatients
- Bed Occupancy Rate
- Department-wise patient count
- Admission trend over time
- Age group distribution
- Mode of payment

---

## 📈 Secondary Analysis

- Average Length of Stay
- Long stay patients
- Medicine usage
- Revenue by category
- Doctor workload
- Surgery reasons
- Growth trend (line chart)

---

## 🧠 Key DAX Measures

Average Length of Stay  
Inpatient Count  
Outpatient Count  
Bed Occupancy %  
Admission Growth  
Age Group Segmentation  

---

## ⚠ Challenges Faced

- Creating calendar table
- Handling null discharge dates
- Designing age groups
- Bed availability logic
- Dashboard alignment in Power BI Service
- File size limitation for GitHub

---

## ✅ Business Insights

- Adults (36–55) represent highest admissions
- Certain departments show longer stays
- Bed utilization highlights ICU availability
- Revenue mainly driven by room charges
- Peak admissions observed monthly

---

## 🎯 Outcome

Built a complete hospital analytics dashboard enabling:

✔ Operational monitoring  
✔ Resource planning  
✔ Patient flow optimization
